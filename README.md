# Regex Tutorial to Validate Emails  

## Description  
This project includes an easy breakdown of what Regex (Regular Expression) are and how they can be used to validate an email in your code.  

Developers write code, but they also write about code. The Challenge is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. You'll use the template provided in the starter code to create your tutorial.  

## User Story
AS A web development student  
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex  
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines  
## Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN a regex tutorial  
WHEN I open the tutorial  
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile  
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents  
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial  
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial  
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does  
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial  
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
